# Melanoma Detection CNN
> To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.

## General Information
- build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early
- A solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma
- The dataset consists of 2357 images of malignant and benign oncological diseases, which were formed from the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC)

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
- The training accuracy seems to be nearly ~90%.
- The validation accuracy is nearly +90%.
- model accuracy has improved, the class rebalance has helped treat the overfitting and improve the accrucy drastically also the extra layers are one of the big factor for this improvement.
- Much better models could be built or tried out using more epochs and more layers.
- also if we incresses the data size by increse the augumanted images sample size then also there is a chance to improve in result.
